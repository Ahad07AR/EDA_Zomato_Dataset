**Project Description: EDA on Zomato Dataset**

The aim of this project is to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset to extract meaningful insights from the data.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: We performed EDA on the Zomato dataset to uncover patterns and insights within the data.

- **Data Manipulation and Analysis Techniques**: Various functions were employed, such as slicing and merging columns using the merge function. Additionally, different analytical techniques were applied to derive valuable content from the dataset.

- **Key Findings**: Through the application of these functions, we concluded that:
  - India is the largest country with the maximum number of transactions.
  - The highest number of zero ratings are from India.
  - Online deliveries are available only in India and the UAE, with the majority of deliveries in India occurring in Delhi.
